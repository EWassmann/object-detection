# object-detection
ObjectDetect.py is the upgraded version, command line code to run it is commented at the top of the file. the caffemodel and prototxt to run it in the repository.
To set confidence interval for display add -c and then the confidence as a decimile onto the end of the other command line code, ie "-c .5"  to only display the boxes when the model is 50 percent sure of its detection
person follow works the same way and is meant to be run with the included arduino code (which works for ball following and person tracking), it needs the same 
prototxt and caffemodel.
